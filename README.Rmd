The goal of codefolder is to provide "aftermarket" code-folding capabilty for [bookdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown) and [distill](https://rstudio.github.io/distill). The operative code is based on this Stack Overflow [answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/45501553) by SÃ©bastien Rochette. 

## Installation

You can install the delevopment version of codefolder from [GitHub](https://github.com/ijlyttle/codefolder) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("ijlyttle/codefolder")
```

## Example

This is a quick way to enable code-folding, for an entire page, on a page-by-page basis. 

The idea is to put an Rmd-chunk near the top of a page. When rendered, the chunk places a button in the right margin which can be used to show or hide code.

There is a function each for Bookdown and Distill. The main argument is `init`, which indicates if you want, initially, to `"show"` or `"hide"` the code. The other arguments are `query`, the CSS selector for to match the code elements, and the `style` to the button.

Bookdown:

````
`r ''````{r codefolder, echo=FALSE, results='asis'}
codefolder::bookdown(init = "hide")
```
````

Distill:

````
<aside>
`r ''````{r codefolder, echo=FALSE, results='asis'}
codefolder::distill(init = "hide")
```
</aside>
````

If you like, you can create these as RStudio [code snippets](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/204463668-Code-Snippets) for markdown. I use `cfb` and `cfd` as my short-codes.

It will be up to you to add some CSS according to your tastes.
